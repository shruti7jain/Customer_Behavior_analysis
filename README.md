# Customer_Behavior_analysis
A customer behavior analytics project using Python, SQL, and Power BI to uncover insights and performance trends. It includes data cleaning, EDA, KPI development, segmentation, and visualization, with an interactive Power BI dashboard presenting actionable metrics, customer patterns, and recommendations.

📌 Overview
This project presents an end‑to‑end customer behavior analytics workflow using Python, SQL, and Power BI. The goal is to uncover key business insights, understand customer patterns, and develop actionable recommendations that support strategic decision‑making. The analysis includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), KPI development, segmentation, and interactive dashboard visualization.

🎯 Objectives
- Analyze customer behavior and purchasing patterns
- Identify key performance indicators (KPIs)
- Perform segmentation to understand customer groups
- Build a clean, structured dataset using SQL and Python
- Visualize insights through an interactive Power BI dashboard
- Provide data‑driven recommendations for business improvement

🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- SQL: Data extraction, filtering, joins, aggregations
